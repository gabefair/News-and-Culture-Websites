"What?: Create a public record of news and culture sites.

Why?: Any autocrat or fascist system of power will fight to remove any information that is inconvenient.

 - It is impossible to know ahead of time what information (art, culture, music, history) might be banned. Glass-skinned people will find any arbitrary symbol or picture or knowledge offensive to their rule of power.
	   
 - Pictures of a yellow bear? Pictures of a certain flower? A picture of a politician holding hands with a family member?
 - Also fake news or misinformation needs to be recorded, as to assist with answering questions like: 
 - "Who was the target of the misinformation campaign?", "How long did the psychological warfare last?", "What lies were manufactured?"
 - The sky's the limit on the number of answers that can be found by studying this archived information in the future.

How?: Raspberry Pi's have been covertly placed in public wifi spots across the country. 
           These devices will visit and archive the sites listed.
           The archive is hosted at archive.is and archive.today and eventually at archive.org.

Who can help?: You can. Add sites you find to be important to the list and help future researchers remember the past. International sites as well, as facism is growing worldwide.
                           If you are willing to run a small VM, this can assist with the effort by helping circumnavigate any google captchas.	
			   
Are some of the links NSFW?: Yes, few sites in the list are included because they have had cultural, political, or historical significance. For example the world news subreddit "r/anime_titties" which despite the name, features world news and politics.
