#### "Experts in authoritarianism advise to keep a list of things subtly changing around you, so you’ll remember." ~Amy Siskind 

- **What**: Create a public record of news and culture sites.

 - **Why**: Any autocrat or fascist system of power will fight to remove any information that is inconvenient.

   - It is impossible to know ahead of time what information (art, culture, music, history) might be banned. Glass-skinned people will find any arbitrary symbol or picture or knowledge offensive to their rule of power.
	   
     - Childhood cartoons of an iconic yellow bear? Drawings of a certain flower? A picture of a politician holding hands with a family member?
     - In addition, fake news or misinformation needs to be preserved, as to assist with answering questions like: 
     - "Who was the target of the misinformation campaign?", "How long did the psychological warfare last?", "What lies were manufactured?"
     - The sky's the limit on the number of answers that can be found by studying this archived information in the future.

 - **How**: Simply visit https://unclegrape.com and click the "save" button. ⭐ Its that easy! ⭐
	   
 - **Where**: Did this list of links come from? It has been continuously hand crafted by me. So it is prone to biases and accidental omissions

 - **Whether or not?**: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/i7uvve/the_truth_is_paywalled_but_the_lies_are_free/
                            -Any comment past L4 is probably off topic. Feel free to comment or respond.

 - **Who can help?**: You can! Add sites you find to be important to the list and help future researchers remember the past! Add sites in any language, as facism is growing worldwide. If you are willing to run a small VM, this can assist with the effort by helping circumnavigate any google captchas.	
			   
 - **Are some of the links NSFW?**: Some of the links are, but they won't come up in the automated scripts. A few sites in the list are included because they have had cultural, political, or historical significance. For example the world news subreddit "r/anime_titties" which despite the name, features world news and politics.
